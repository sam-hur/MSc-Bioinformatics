#### Learning outcomes
- Account for and use methods in structural bioinformatics : Classification of protein structure, prediction, simulations, and structure based drug-design
- Analyse and compile results of structural analyses
- Solve given biological problems by using appropriate databases


#### Course material
- Generic competences: Presented at welcome days, online material from Lena
- Bioinformatics possibilities, limitations, and role in society: Lecture notes, scientific articles
- Linux: Lecture notes: online material
- Sequence and structural bioinformatics

#### Course assignments
- Popular science assignment
- 1. Group written assignment
- Individual oral presentation
- Individual feedback to another group's writing
- Individual improvement of the writing
- *Details will be explained later

#### Computer exercises: Linux, Sequence & Structure
- Introduction to Linux involves a hand-in exercise
- The sequence bioinformatics exercises will involve a combination of reports and oral examination
- the structural bioinformatics exercises will only involve an oral examination
- if you cannot attend, email the students responsible for the labs, so the problems can be solved.
- *Always check Studium for the latest schedule!*

*You will receive the login to the Linux account to your student email. You need to bring this information to the exercise. If you cannot find it, please check your spam folder.*
### Exams are on [Inspera](https://www.inspera.com/), ~ 6 hours


#### Lecture 1 - [[1MB348 - (L1) Introduction]]
#### Lecture 2 - 
#### Lecture 5 - [[1MB348 - (L5) Genome Anotation]]
