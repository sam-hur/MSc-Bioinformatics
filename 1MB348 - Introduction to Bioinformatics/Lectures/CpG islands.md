## Definition
___
CpG islands are regions of DNA that contain a high frequency of cytosine-guanine (CpG) dinucleotide sequences. In these sequences, a cytosine molecule is followed by a guanine molecule in the DNA strand. CpG islands are typically found in the promoter regions of genes, which are crucial for the regulation of gene expression.

The CPG Islands are regions of a gene that have a high percentager of CG sites, where the `C` is Methylated. Researchers have proved that about 70% of promoter regions are rich in CpG Islands


### Key characteristics
___
The study of CpG islands and DNA methylation patterns is critical in understanding gene regulation, epigenetics, and the role of DNA methylation in various diseases, including cancer and developmental disorders. Researchers often use techniques like [[bisulfite sequencing]] to analyze the methylation status of CpG islands and explore their functional significance in health and disease.

1. High CpG Density: CpG islands are defined by having a higher density of CpG dinucleotides compared to the rest of the genome. While CpG dinucleotides are relatively rare in the overall genome, CpG islands can contain clusters of them.

2. Promoter Proximity: CpG islands are often located near the promoter regions of genes. Promoter regions are essential for the initiation of transcription, the first step in the process of gene expression.

3. Methylation: CpG islands can be subject to DNA methylation, a chemical modification that involves the addition of a methyl group (CH3) to the cytosine of a CpG dinucleotide. Methylation at CpG sites can influence gene expression by inhibiting the binding of transcription factors and other regulatory proteins to the promoter region, effectively silencing the gene.

4. Gene Regulation: The methylation status of CpG islands is crucial for gene regulation. Hypermethylation (excessive methylation) of CpG islands is associated with gene silencing, often observed in diseases like cancer, where tumor suppressor genes are inactivated. Hypomethylation (low methylation) can lead to the inappropriate activation of genes, which can also contribute to diseases.

5. Tissue-Specific: CpG islands can have tissue-specific methylation patterns, meaning that they may be methylated in some tissues but not in others. This tissue-specific regulation of gene expression is essential for the development and function of different cell types in the body.
