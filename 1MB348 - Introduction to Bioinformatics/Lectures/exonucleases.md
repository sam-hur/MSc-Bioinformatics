Exonucleases are a class of enzymes that catalyze the removal of nucleotide units from the ends of DNA or RNA molecules. They are involved in various cellular processes, including DNA repair, RNA degradation, and nucleotide metabolism. Exonucleases cleave nucleotides one at a time from the end of a polynucleotide chain, as op[[Endonucleases]]ucleases]]*, which cleave within the chain.

Exonucleases can be further categorized into two main types based on the end they act upon:

1. **3' to 5' Exonucleases:** These enzymes remove nucleotides from the 3' end of a DNA or RNA molecule. They move along the chain in the 3' to 5' direction, cleaving nucleotides one by one from the end. DNA polymerase I, a well-known 3' to 5' exonuclease in prokaryotes, is involved in DNA repair and proofreading during DNA replication.
    
2. **5' to 3' Exonucleases:** These enzymes remove nucleotides from the 5' end of a DNA or RNA molecule. They work by cleaving nucleotides one at a time from the 5' end. An example of a 5' to 3' exonuclease is the cellular machinery involved in RNA degradation, such as the 5' to 3' exoribonuclease XRN1.
    

Exonucleases are essential for maintaining the integrity of genetic material, repairing damaged DNA, and regulating gene expression by degrading or processing RNA molecules. They play critical roles in processes like DNA proofreading, DNA repair, RNA turnover, and mRNA decay, ensuring the accuracy of genetic information and controlling the levels of specific RNA molecules within a cell.
