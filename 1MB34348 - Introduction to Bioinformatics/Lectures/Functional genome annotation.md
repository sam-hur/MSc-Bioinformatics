## Definition
___
Find out what coding regions in a genome or DNA sequence do by inferring biological information to the genomic elements. It is the step taken after [[structural genome annotation]].

<u>Includes exploring:</u>
1. Biochemical function
2. Biological function
3. Gene Expression 
4. What protein is formed, and what the function is of that protein

Additionally (AI-generated):
5. Integration of Data:
	- Functional genomics often involves integrating multiple types of data, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and more. This holistic approach helps researchers gain a comprehensive understanding of how genes and their products contribute to biological processes.

6. Identifying Relationships:
	- Functional genomic annotation helps identify relationships between genes, proteins, and biological processes. It can reveal how genes interact with one another, participate in pathways, and contribute to specific cellular functions.
