## 1. Exploratory
- Dimension/variable reduction (Principal Components) â€“ PCA
- Multivariate analysis (Clustering, Classification, Ordination)

## Hypothesis testing
-  Differential expression analysis (ANOVA and GLMs)
-  GWAS - testing relationships with SNPs (correlation, regression)
-  analysis of gene frequencies (chi-2)
-  Multivariate relationships (Canonical correlation, MANOVA)
-  Resampling

## Theory
- Hypothesis testing
- P-value
- Type I and Type II errors
- Mathematical distributions
- Level of replication
- [[Complex experiments â€“ Simpsons Paradox]]
- Understanding multivariate problems
- Variable reduction
- Multiple testing â€“ False discovery rates

## Terminology
- Variable, response, predictor, etc.

### Theory and application
- 1-way ANOVA/t-test
- Simple regression/correlation
- Analysis of frequencies
- Experimental design
- multifactorial ANOVA
- multiple Regression

## Hypothesis testing
- [[Null hypothesis]] (H<sub>0</sub>)
- [[Alternative hypothesis]] (H<sub>A</sub>)
- [[P-value]]
- [[Type I and Type II errors]]


###  ðŸ“˜ Replication Crisis in Science
-  High impact publication requires extraordinary results
-  Replication of such experiments have proven problematic
- This has caused some to question the scientific conduct in general, and the robustness of the results published in high impact journals, in particular.


## ðŸ“™ Base rate fallacy & the False positive paradox
*When the incidence rate of a condition is lower than the false positive rate, false positive tests are more common than true positive tests.*
