# Outline
___
### Univariate Basics
-- See [[Univariate data]], [[Univariate Analysis]]
- Correlation
- Simple regression analysis
- R-example
#### Introduction to multiple regression
- Correlation matrices and co-linearity
- [[Partial correlations]]
- R-example

## Correlation & Regression
___
- Measures the relationships between two or more <u>continuous</u> variables
- Observations are paired/dependent a priori

*Read up on -- [[ANCOVA]] models + [[PLS]]*



### Application
___
- Correlate genetic features that are measured on continuous scale with some other biological (continuous) variables.
	- GWAS - e.g., look for statistical associations between SNP frequency and ecological factors or phenotype (later on this course)
	- Expression analysis – e.g., look for associations between expression of candidate gene or protein and biological feature.

- Related to many multivariate approaches used to look for statistical associations in more complex (common) omics datasets 
	- e.g., [[Principal Component Analysis (PCA)]], CCA and PLS – later on in this course


### Correlation
___
- Measures the strength of relationships between two or more variables
- Data measured on ordinal, interval, or ratio scales.
- Relationship = positive, negative, or null (i.e., [[Null hypothesis]]).
- Parametric version: [[Pearson's (product-moment) correlation]]
- Non-parametric version: [[Spearman's rank correlation]]
