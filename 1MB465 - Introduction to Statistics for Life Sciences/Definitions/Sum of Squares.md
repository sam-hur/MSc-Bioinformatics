The term sum of squares refers to a statistical technique used in [[Regression Analysis 2]] **to determine the dispersion of data points**. The sum of squares can be used to find the function that best fits by varying the least from the data.

The Sum of squares is also heavily used in [[Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)]] statistics to determine whether there are significant differences among the means of multiple groups.


#### Formulae
___

##### Total Sum of Squares
$$
SS_T = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j=1}^{k} (X_{ij} - \bar{X})^2
$$

##### Between-Subjects Sum of Squares ($SS_B$)
$$
SS_B = \sum_{i=1}^{N} k (\bar{X}_i - \bar{X})^2
$$
- where $k$ = the number of groups/conditions

##### Within-Subjects Sum of Squares (SSW)
$$
SS_W = SST - SSB
$$
