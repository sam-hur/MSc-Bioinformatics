## Definition
___
Covariance **measures the direction of a relationship between two variables**, while correlation measures the strength of that relationship. Both correlation and covariance are positive when the variables move in the same direction and negative when they move in opposite directions.


### Covariance Matrices
___
A Covariance Matrix is **a type of matrix used to describe the covariance values between two items in a random vector**. It is also known as the variance-covariance matrix because the variance of each element is represented along the matrix's major diagonal and the covariance is represented among the non-diagonal elements.
