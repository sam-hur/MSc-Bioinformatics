## Definition
___
A <u>one-way</u> (or single-factor) [[Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)]] is a statistical test used (with [[Univariate Analysis]]) to compare the means of three or more groups. By comparing their means, we can determine if they are significantly different from each other in <u>terms of a single variable or factor</u>.
