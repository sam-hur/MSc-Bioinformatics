- Shows you how good your data is
	- It does this by providing more insight on the mean than a simple bar graph (without error bars) would (e.g., by showing how distored the data is - as can be judged by the size of the error bars).
	- It takes the standard deviation and divides it by the square root of the sample size:
	$$	SE_\bar{x} = \frac{S}{\sqrt{n}} $$
