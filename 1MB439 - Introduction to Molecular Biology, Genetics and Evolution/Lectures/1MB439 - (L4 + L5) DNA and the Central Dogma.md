# Nucleotide (Monomer of Nucleic Acid)
the key to the function of DNA (and RNA) is in the structure
of DNA and RNA are nucleic acids, built up by nucleotides:

Nitrogen Base + Pentos-sugar + Phosphate

Nucleotides can have variable number of phosphate groups
- Nucleotides with 1, 2 or 3 phosphate groups are called “nucleoside-mono-phosphate” (NMP)., “nucleoside-di-phosphate” (NDP) or “nucleoside triphosphate (NTP)”.

- *Pyrimidines*: small bases (1 ring)
	- T C U
- *Purines*: large bases (2 rings)
	- A G
- Sugar in DNA lacks **-OH**
	- Deoxy
	- Therefore less reactive

### Nucleoside
> A *nucleoside* contains a nitrogenous base and a pentose sugar (no phosphate group)
> A *nucleotide* is a nucleoside with a phosphate group in the C-5' position


- **Primes on Nucleic Acid, e.g., 3 prime ends and 5 prime ends on polynucleotides**.

### **Polynucleotides have a sugar-phosphate backbone with negative charges (PO4-)**

### Nucleic Acid composition
- Short chain of ~100 nucleotides are called oligonucleotides, chains longer than that are called polynucleotides

#### Nucleotides can be combined in many ways
- Ability to store large amounts of genetic data
- Results in large genetic variation

### **theta (θ) – tilt of DNA double helix**

- G-C has 3 hydrogen bonds (stronger)
- A-T has 2 hydrogen bonds (weaker)

# In RNA
-  A base pair with U
-  A G base pair with U
- Secondary/tertiary structure is usually required for functionality of single stranded RNA
#### Ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
Approx 80% of all RNA cells found in the body, and it is a component of [[ribosomes]].

# Central Dogma
Is a flow of genetic information from DNA (replication) → transcription ⇾ RNA → translation ⇾ Protein.
