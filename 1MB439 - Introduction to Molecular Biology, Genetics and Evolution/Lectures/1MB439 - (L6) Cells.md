### Recaps
---
- Gene Mutations
	- Point Mutations
		- Single nucleotide affected
		- For protein coding genes:
			- Missense: Change to a codon that code for a different AA
			- Nonsense: Introduces a stop codon
			- Silent: Change to another codon that codes for the same AA
			- Insertion/deletion causes frame-shift.
				- Unless an integer set of 3 nucleotides are added/lost.
	- Example of mutations causing a large effect:
		- Sickle-cell anemia


## The Cell
___
*Read at home: ***Microscopy**

#### Definition
---
The smallest biological unit that can be considered a living entity.
- Cell can independently self-replicate
- Viruses don't consist of cells, since they can't replace on their own, but instead need help from a host cell.

##### Criteria to be a cell – 1957 (*important*)
---
1. Viruses posses only one type of DNA or RNA genome `*
2. Viruses do not divide by themselves (Binary fission)
3. Viruses do not encode a protein translation apparatus `*`
4. Viruses do not synthesize the ATP that they consume for the replication

 `*` → now considered Ambiguous


###### Cell Types: Eukaryotic (w. nucleus + multicellular) / Prokaryotic (no nucleus + single cellular)

##### **Cell ingredients based on weight:**
___
65% water
20% proteins
5% lipids
3% nucleic acids
3% carbohydrates
3% smaller organic molecules
1% ions
___

- Cell = Biochemistry + Structure

___

___


### Prokaryotic Cells
---
**Nucleoid**
- Region where the cell's DNA is located (non membrane bound)

**Fimbriae/pili/curli**
- Attachment of fiber structured (head)



#### Eukaryotic Cell (Animals)
___
**Peroxisome**
-  are <u>specialized for carrying out oxidative reactions using molecular oxygen</u>
- play important roles in metabolism, reactive oxygen species detoxification, and signalling

**Microvilli**
- finger-like membrane protrusions, supported by the actin cytoskeleton
- found in almost all cell types
- A growing body of evidence suggests that the dynamic lymphocyte microvilli, with their highly curved membranes, play an important role in signal transduction leading to immune responses.

**Cytoskeleton**
The cytoskeleton is a complex, dynamic network of interlinking protein filaments present in the cytoplasm of all cells, including those of bacteria and archaea. In eukaryotes, it extends from the cell nucleus to the cell membrane and is composed of similar proteins in the various organisms.

**Centrosome**
A centrosome is <u>a cellular structure involved in the process of cell division</u>. Before cell division, the centrosome duplicates and then, as division begins, the two centrosomes move to opposite ends of the cell.


*Rough ER → ER lumen + Cisternae*

*E1, E2 and E3 enzymes*
#### Eukaryotic Cell (Plants)
___
**Nuclear Envelope**
The nuclear envelope (NE) is <u>a highly regulated membrane barrier that separates the nucleus from the cytoplasm in eukaryotic cells</u>
- It contains many different proteins that have been implicated in chromatin organization and gene regulation.

**Nucleolus**
The nucleolus is <u>a spherical structure found in the cell's nucleus whose primary function is to produce and assemble the cell's ribosomes</u>

**Central vacuole** (plants)
In a plant cell, the central vacuole stores water and regulates turgor pressure. Additionally, it forces the cell's contents toward the membrane, enabling plant cells to absorb more light energy for photosynthesis, the process of turning sunlight into food.

**Cell Wall** (plants)
The cell wall surrounds the plasma membrane of plant cells and provides tensile strength and protection against mechanical and osmotic stress.

**Chloroplast** (plants)
a type of membrane-bound organelle known as a plastid that conducts photosynthesis mostly in plant and algal cells

![[Pasted image 20230912163654.png | center-align | 500]]



**Plasmodesmata** (plants)
microscopic channels which traverse the cell walls of plant cells and some algal cells, enabling transport and communication between them.

![[Pasted image 20230912163841.png | center-align]]

### **Vesicles**: **Lysosome**, the bulk waste disposal system
___
- Acidic (Low pH) small membrane bubbles

- Filled with ~40 different types of acidic hydrolases, which can break down various macromolecules. The hydrolases are only active at low pH.

- Transport protein, pumping in the H<sup>+</sup> in the lysosome

___
