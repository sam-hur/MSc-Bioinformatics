##  Only H's and C's
The H-C bond is non-polar, hence hydrocarbons do not mix well with water.

- Hydrophobic
	- *Cannot* form H-bonds with water
- Hydrophilic
	- *Can* form H-bonds with water
##### Examples of hydrocarbons
- **Methane**

## Classes of hydrocarbons
- Length
- Double bond position
- Branching
- Presence of rings

#### Some characteristics of hydrocarbons:
- They don't dissolve in water,
- Energy storage, released when burnt or broken down

### Functional Group
- Substitute hydrogens in hydrocarbons with something else
- Gives “function” to a carbon “backbone”
- Most groups are polar (have areas with partial positive or negative charge)
	- **Groups**
		- Hydroxyl
