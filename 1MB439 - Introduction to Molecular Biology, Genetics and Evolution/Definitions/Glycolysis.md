Glycolysis is the anaerobic metabolises of glucose (the process through which it is broken down) to output [[Pyruvate (Pyruvic Acid)]]. It produces two molecules of pyruvate, [[adenosine triphosphate (ATP)]], [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH)]], [[flavin adenine nucleotide (FADH2)]] and water (H2O).
