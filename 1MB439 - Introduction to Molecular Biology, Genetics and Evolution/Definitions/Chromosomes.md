#### Prokaryotic Chromosome Structure
___
Prokaryotic (and also viral) chromosomes generally: - consist of only one nucelic acid molecule - are much smaller than eukaryotic chromosomes - are organised in loops, supercoils and other packing elements

The amount of DNA is large. Approx. 2m DNA must fit in a single human cell nucleus. In order to fit the genetic material and still enable the use of it, advanced packing mechanisms have evolved.

### Histone proteins
___


### Nucleosomes
___


### Solenoid
___


### Chromatid
___
> Cannot synthesize new mRNA while in Chromatid/Chromosome format

> By chemically modifying the histone tails, it becomes possible to loosen the chromatid
