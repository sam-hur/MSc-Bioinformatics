___
*Saccharide* → another term for a sugar
___
#### Monosaccharides
- Can swap between a linear ring form
- The ring form is the biologically active one
- The most basic form of carbohydrates
###### glucose:
- a hexose (6 carbon)
- **primary energy source for animals**
- monomer unit of starch, glycogen, and cellulose

###### ribose
- a pentose (5-caron)
- part of the backbone in RNA


#### [[The Glycosidic Bond]]

- Monosaccharides can be linked together into disaccharides and polysaccharides
> Sucrose = Glucose + fructose
> Lactose = Glucose + galactose
> Maltose = 

---
**To use energy, it needs to be broken down to monosaccharides**
___


#### Polysaccharides
##### Storage
Fuel, hydrolysed to get sugars for cells, branched
- Starch in plants 
	- Amylose
	- Amylopectin
- Glycogen in animals
##### Structure
Strong material, hydrogen bonded microfibrili, unbranched
- Cellulose in plants (makes the cell wall)
- β-Glucose monomer
