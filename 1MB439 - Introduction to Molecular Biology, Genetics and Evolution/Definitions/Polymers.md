### Introduction
- Built from [[Monomers]]
- Long chain of building blocks linked by covalent bonds.
- Flexibility to built arbitrarily large structures
- Small molecules common to all organisms ordered into unique macromolecules
- Limited number of chemical reactions needed to process the molecules
- Monomers can be recycled for the fraction of the cost of building a new monomers
- Backbone gives shape and functional groups give function
- Can modify the chemical structure of the monomers comprising the polymer, allowing for a greater degree of versatility and modification.
#### Polymerization
- Dehydration (or condensation) reaction
	- Dehydration removes a water molecule, forming a new bond
- Catalysed by enzymes in the cell, a type of protein
- Opposite of Hydrolysis.

#### Hydrolysis
- Adds a water molecule, breaking a bond
- Catalysed by enzymes in the cell, a type of protein
